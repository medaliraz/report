abstract = {8.1 Introduction to organic solar cells Conventional solar cells were invented in the 1950s and first commercialized in the 1960s for use in space programs. Since then there have been rapid advances in the efficiency and reliability of these cells, along with a substantial decrease in their fabrication costs. As a result the photovoltaic industry has been growing rapidly. Nevertheless the price of solar electricity is still greater than the price of electricity from the electrical grid in industrialized countries. For this reason there is an increasing amount of research devoted to potentially less expensive types of solar cells such as those based on organic dyes and polymers. These cells have been studied since the late 1950s albeit at a fairly low level until recently. One of the great promises of organic electronics is that synthetic chemists can produce compounds matching the opto-electronic properties desired. A fundamental difference between solar cells based on organic materials and conventional inorganic photovoltaic (IPV) cells is that light absorption results in the formation of excitons in molecular materials, rather than in free electrons and holes. An exciton in an organic semiconductor can be considered as a tightly coulombicly bound electron hole pair. Due to its electrical neutrality and the strong binding energy between the hole and the electron it can be regarded as a mobile excited state. Due this fundamental difference the processes involved in the conversion of photons into electrical energy are not},
